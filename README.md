# Deep-Learning-Mini-Projects

Deep Learning is a field which is quite interesting to me and vastly growing. With great developments in it, I aim to learn by creating projects in it.

Each folder has different project and an encompassing README.md as a manual to the corresponding project.

This repo will consist of the following learning techniques:

1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning
